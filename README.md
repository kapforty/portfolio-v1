I completed all three parts of this homework assignment. For part 1, I used a simple JSON to HTML table script as recommended in the homework writeup. For part three, I decided to implement the button-count component in both React and Vue. The buttonCountReact.js file is for the React implementation. I did not create an additional JavaScript file for the Vue implementation.
