The first change that I made was to the header. Instead of having the navbar to the right of the screen, I decided to center it. It looks much better especially on mobile devices. The next change I made was to the project section of the page. Before, the projects section was just a horizontal flexbox that had three images and three captions. I added hover animations, shadows, rounded borders and rewrote the captions to be more concise and cleaner to read. I also added more responsive features to this section. Prior to the changes, the three projects that I showcase would sit horizontally in the flexbox regardless of screen width. This did not look the best, espeically on mobile. So I added media queries to display the projects vertically when the screen width reached the width of a standard phone. I then reworked the experience section. The logos/images now appear as circles instead of squares which gives the page a more refined look. I also switched from a grid to a flexbox and reworked the organization of the content. The image is smaller and the role title, date, and company sit next to the image. I then added the notes from each experience to sit underneath this content. This design also made the site look cleaner and more organized, especially on mobile. The last few changes I made were in the skills and footer section. For skills, I edited the margins/padding to fit closer together, thus occupying less space. Lastly, I added a purple background color to the footer which I think looks more appealing. I also added media queries, removing the footer from appearing on mobile devices for a minimalist look.
